Valentine's Day calls for a scent that makes everyone ask "what are you wearing?" — so here's my curated guide to the best gourmand perfumes for women who want to smell like a warm, chic dream.

## What Is a Gourmand Fragrance?

Gourmand fragrances are scents built around edible, dessert-like notes — think vanilla, caramel, chocolate, coffee, honey, and warm spices. They're cozy, inviting, and absolutely addictive.

### My Signature Scent Philosophy

Your fragrance should feel like an extension of who you are. I believe in:

- **Layering** — Pair a scented body cream with your perfume for all-day staying power
- **Sampling first** — Never blind-buy an expensive fragrance
- **Seasonal rotation** — Gourmands shine in fall/winter but lighter vanillas work year-round
- **Confidence** — The best perfume is the one that makes *you* feel incredible

## The Picks, Ranked

Baccarat Rouge is the undisputed queen of gourmand luxury — it literally gets a perfect 10 Signature Number from me. But Missing Person by Phlur is the best value-to-wow ratio I've ever experienced.

## How to Make Your Scent Last

1. Apply to pulse points — wrists, neck, behind ears
2. Layer with matching or complementary body cream
3. Spritz on clothes (fabric holds scent longer than skin)
4. Don't rub your wrists together — it breaks down the molecules
5. Store perfume away from heat and sunlight
