Easter brunch is one of my favorite hosting moments of the year. There's something about a beautifully set spring table that just makes the whole meal feel more special. Here are my curated picks to create the most aesthetic Easter table without spending a fortune.

## The Aesthetic Formula

A beautiful table setting comes down to three layers:

1. **The Base** — A great tablecloth or linen runner sets the tone
2. **The Place Setting** — Coordinated plates, napkins, and flatware
3. **The Centerpiece** — Flowers, candles, or a curated arrangement

### Color Palette

This year I'm going with a soft palette of:
- Cream and ivory as the base
- Blush pink and sage green accents
- Gold metallic touches for that signature sparkle

## Styling Tips

- **Mix high and low** — Pair your Pottery Barn plates with Target flatware
- **Add height** — Use candlesticks at varying heights for visual interest
- **Personal touches** — A handwritten place card at each setting goes a long way
- **Keep it simple** — An overly fussy table can feel stressful, not special

> "The table is a meeting place, a gathering ground, the source of sustenance and nourishment." — Laurie Colwin

## My Easter Menu Pairing

These table settings pair perfectly with a light spring brunch: think lemon ricotta pancakes, a beautiful fruit board, sparkling mimosas, and mini quiches. The aesthetic is soft, inviting, and effortlessly chic.
